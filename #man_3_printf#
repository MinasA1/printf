.SH NAME
_printf \- simple replication of printf function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "holberton.h"

.B int _printf(const char \fI*format\fRq\fB, ...)\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB_printf()\fR produces output according  to  a \fformat\fR as described below. This function writes to  \fIstdout\fR, the  standard  output stream, under the control of a format string that specifies how  subsequent arguments  (or  arguments  accessed  via the variable-length argument facilities of \fBstdarg\fR(3)) are convertedfor output.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return,  these  functions  return  the number  of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

.SH THE CONVERSION SPECIFIER
A character that specifies the type of  conversion  to be applied.  The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
\fBd\fR, \fBi\fR
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.   The  precision,  if  any, gives the minimum number of digits that must  appear;  if the  converted  value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.  The  default precision  is  1.   When  0  is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.
.TP
\fBc\fR
The  int  argument is  converted  to  an  unsigned  char,  and the resulting character is written.
.TP
\fBs\fR
The const char * argument is expected to  be  a  pointer  to  an
array  of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array  are  written  up  to(but  not  including)  a  terminating null byte ('\0'); if a precision is  specified,  no  more than  the  number  specified are written.  If a precision  is  given,  no  null  byte  need  be present;  if the precision is not specified, or is greater than the  size  of  the  array,  the array must contain a terminating null byte.
.TP
\fB%\fR
A '%' is written.  No  argument  is  converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
